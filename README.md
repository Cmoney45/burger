# Burger app

## Description

This app was designed to be simple and interact with a backend database of MySQL. It allows you to post to the database as well as change states based on which buttons are clicked. 

## Technologies

I am using MySQL as the backend server and database. I are using Handlebars as a front end framework. I used the Phantom layout from HTML5 UP and configured it to work for my purposes.
